Assignment 1

1) What random name did you use for the directory on the server?

  The directory to my php file is as follows

  ovillegas2/JavaToPhp/expression.php


2) How long did you spend to do this assignment?

  It took me approximately 6 workings hours to complete translate the Java
  code to PHP including testing.


3) What problems (if any) did you encounter in this assignment, and if
yes, how did you solve the problems?

  This assignment was pretty straight forward. Most of the translation was
  trivial. The difficulty arose when trying to find functions that had similar
  functionality to Java methods. The bulk of the time for completing this
  assignment was spent researching functions that would be appropriate
  replacements for the Java methods found. In particular the php function
  fgets() was causing erroneous results as I was not aware that it reads a line
  from a file but also includes the new line character. This nuance caused
  the index to increment after the end of the expression causing the error.
  Overall, this was assignment was helpful as it refreshed my php skills and
  allowed me to discover new, useful functions.
